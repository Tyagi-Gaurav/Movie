## Framework for system design interview

* Questions to clarify requirements
  * What specific features are we going to build? or what are the requirements from an end user point of view? 
  * How many users does the product have?
  * How fast does the company anticipate a scale up? What are anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months, and year?
  * What is the company's tech stack? 
  * How much data do we anticipate?
  * Is this a web app or mobile app?

* Design
  * Draw box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper. This might include clients (mobile/web), APIs, web servers, data stores, 
  cache, CDN, message queue, etc.
  * Think out loud.
  * If possible, go through a few concrete use cases.
  * Do back-of-the-envelope calculations to evaluate if your blueprint fits the scale constraints.
